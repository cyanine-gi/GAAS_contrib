# Ground Control Station for Autonomous Flying Cars

### These stations are placed with a pattern of cellular. Just like the way your mobile phone and its base stations work.

#####    Each station contains some small hexagons. Each hexagon contains multiple layers with different height.

#####    When a vehicle try to plan its path: the stations in this path are involved, and hexagons with a certain altitude(in other words, 3d cellulars) are distributed to this vehicle by these stations. If path is generated successfully by stations, these 3d cellulars are set status "occupied", which will be maintained by these stations.
